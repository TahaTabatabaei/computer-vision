# Basic algorithms in computer vision, university homeworks

This repository contains my solutions for homeworks and exercises of the Computer vision course at the Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, Fall 2022.

It contains 7 folders, each named with a format of:

>hw + (a number from 1 to 7)

Which specify each homework of others. Each folder contains three types of files.

- **functions.py**: This file includes all the functions and methods implemneted by me, or codes from around the web. 
- **main.ipynb**: This file is a kind of playground, which uses functions in `functions.py` and some other basic or third-party libraries in order to provide a solution to an exercise. In this file, first comes the problem and second, the solution code.
- **images**: Images provided by the homework designer in the formats of `BMP` or `JPG`.
